Google Compute engine: 
    - virtual machine, create a debian os vm start as following steps.
    - Ex to run compute engine: debian default vm
        sudo su
        apt update 
        apt install apache2
        ls /var/www/html
        echo "Hello World!"
        echo "Hello World!" > /var/www/html/index.html
        echo $(hostname)
        echo $(hostname -i)
        echo "Hello World from $(hostname)"
        echo "Hello World from $(hostname) $(hostname -i)"
        echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -i)" > /var/www/html/index.html
        sudo service apache2 start

IP Address of virual machine           -                   Description

    Internal IP address                         Permanent Internal IP, does not change during 
                                                lifetime of instance. Internal permannent IP of VM

    External / Ephemeral IP address             Ephemeral/External IP Address that changes when
                                                Instance is stopped. used communicate externally.

    Static external IP Address                  Permanent external IP addr that can be attached to VM
                                                We can make external IP to not change when vm stops.
                                                Search :  Reserve a static address

Simplify VM HTTP Server setup:
    Options to do that:
        Startup Script : 
        Instance Temaplte :

        Custom Image : 
            Installing OS patches and sodtwares at launch of instance increase boot up time.
            So in GCP we can create custom custom image with OS patches and soft preinstall
            Custom image can be created from instance, hdd, a snapshot, another image, or cloud storage
            Can be shared across project
            Deprecate old image and can specify new image. --Recommended
            Hardning an image - customize image with your corporate security standard --Recommended
    #!/bin/bash
    apt update 
    apt -y install apache2
    echo "Hello world from $(hostname) $(hostname -I)" > /var/www/html/index.html
